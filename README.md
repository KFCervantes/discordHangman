# discordHangman
Discord bot that allows members of a server to play hangman.

The file [words_dictionary.json](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json) was taken from [dwyl's english-words repository](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).

The variables `client.game_channel_id` and `token` in hangman.py are set to `None` in this repository for privacy reasons. In order to work they must be changed to the id of the discord channel and the bot's token respectively.
